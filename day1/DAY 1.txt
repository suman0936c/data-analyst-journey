DAY 1 – DATA ANALYST JOURNEY
Topic: Data Understanding, Cleaning & SQL Analysis
Dataset: Superstore Sales Dataset
Tools Used: LibreOffice Calc, MySQL Workbench
    1. Objective of Day 1
The objective of Day 1 was to:
    • Understand a real-world dataset
    • Clean and standardize messy data (dates)
    • Import data into MySQL
    • Perform basic SQL analysis
    • Think like a data analyst, not just write queries
    2. Dataset Description
The dataset used is a Superstore Sales Dataset, which represents sales transactions of a retail business.
Each row represents:
    • One product sold in an order
Important columns used:
    • Order ID
    • Order Date
    • Ship Date
    • Region
    • Category
    • Sub-Category
    • Sales
    • Profit
    • Quantit
    3.  Initial Problem Faced
When exploring the dataset, I observed that:
    • The Order Date and Ship Date columns had mixed formats, such as:
        ? 11-08-2016
        ? 4/15/2017
        ? 2016-09-12
Because of mixed date formats:
    • MySQL failed to import dates correctly
    • Spreadsheet auto-formatting caused errors
This is a real-world data issue, not a beginner mistake.

    4.  Data Cleaning in Spreadsheet (LibreOffice)
Steps followed:
    1. Opened the CSV file in LibreOffice Calc
    2. Carefully analyzed date patterns
    3. Split date components (day, month, year) into separate columns
    4. Reconstructed dates manually using logic
    5. Converted all dates into a single standard format
Final standardized date format:
YYYY-MM-DD
Key learning:
Automatic tools fail on messy data. Logical thinking works.


    5. Final Clean Dataset
After cleaning:
    • All date values were consistent
    • No slashes (/) or mixed formats remained
    • Dataset was safe for database import
The cleaned file was saved as:
superstore_final.csv
    6. Creating Database and Table in MySQL
Database creation:
CREATE DATABASE data_analyst;
USE data_analyst;
Table creation:
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id VARCHAR(50),
    order_date DATE,
    ship_date DATE,
    region VARCHAR(50),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    sub_category VARCHAR(50),
    sales DECIMAL(10,2),
    profit DECIMAL(10,2),
    quantity INT
);


    7. Importing Data into MySQL
Steps:
    1. Open MySQL Workbench
    2. Select the data_analyst database
    3. Use Table Data Import Wizard
    4. Import superstore_final.csv
    5. Fix column mapping issues (duplicate category error)
    6. Successfully imported all rows
Verification:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 5;


    8.  SQL Analysis Performed
8.1 Total Sales and Profit
SELECT 
  ROUND(SUM(sales),2) AS total_sales,
  ROUND(SUM(profit),2) AS total_profit
FROM orders;


8.2 Date Range of Business
SELECT 
  MIN(order_date) AS first_order,
  MAX(order_date) AS last_order
FROM orders; 

8.3 Region-wise Performance
SELECT 
  region,
  ROUND(SUM(sales),2) AS total_sales,
  ROUND(SUM(profit),2) AS total_profit
FROM orders
GROUP BY region;


8.4 Category-wise Profit
SELECT 
  category,
  ROUND(SUM(profit),2) AS total_profit
FROM orders
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

8.5 Profit Margin by Region
SELECT 
  region,
  ROUND((SUM(profit)/SUM(sales))*100,2) AS profit_margin
FROM orders
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY profit_margin DESC;


    9. Key Insights from Day 1
    • The business operates across multiple years
    • Some regions generate high sales but low profit
    • Certain categories have weak profit margins
    • Profit margin is a better metric than sales alone
    10. Business Recommendation
Based on Day 1 analysis:
    • Focus on improving low-margin categories
    • Investigate regions with high sales but low profit
    • Optimize discount and pricing strategies
    11. Key Learnings from Day 1
    • Real datasets are messy
    • Data cleaning is more important than modeling
    • SQL is not just for queries, but for insights
    • Logical thinking beats tool dependency
